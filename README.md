# 2-LayerNeuralNetwork
This is ML third Assignment

You need to code gradient descent algorithm for a 2-layer neural network (make sure you understand what that means). 

1. Start by creating any dataset of your choice. The output labels should be binary. 
2. Initialize parameter values at random 
3. Set your alpha parameter 
4. Run gradient descent algorithm by updating weights until the gradient becomes less than 0.01. 
5. Report the final values of weights that can be used to make predictions 
6. Visualize the loss agains each epoch. You should run at least 200 epochs.
